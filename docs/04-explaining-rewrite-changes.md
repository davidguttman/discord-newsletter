# Technical Explanation of Changes from v1

This document outlines the major technical changes implemented between the `v1` branch and the current state of the `main` branch. The project underwent a significant rewrite, transitioning from a collection of scripts to a more structured, API-driven application.

## Key Architectural Changes

1.  **API Introduction:** The biggest change is the introduction of a web server (`server.js`, likely using Express.js or a similar framework) and API endpoints located in the `api/` directory. This replaces the previous script-based execution (`index.js` was deleted).
2.  **Modular Structure:** Functionality is now broken down into distinct modules within the `lib/` directory:
    *   `lib/mongo/`: Handles MongoDB interactions, replacing the older `lib/db.js`. It includes separate files for production (`mongo.js`) and testing (`mock-mongo.js`), likely using `mongodb-memory-server` for tests.
    *   `lib/discord/`: The existing Discord functionality has been refactored, potentially to integrate better with the API and includes separate test mocks (`discord-test.js`).
    *   `lib/openai/`: New module for interacting with the OpenAI API, likely for summarization features (`api/summarize.js`). Includes test mocks (`openai-test.js`).
    *   `lib/email/`: New module for handling email sending (`email.js`), possibly for sending summaries (`api/email-summary.js`). Includes test mocks (`email-test.js`).
    *   `lib/message-formatter.js`: A dedicated module for formatting Discord messages, perhaps for different output types (plain text, HTML).
    *   `lib/auto-catch.js`: Utility likely for handling errors in async route handlers.
3.  **Configuration Management:** Configuration is centralized in the `config/` directory, replacing the old top-level `config.js`.
4.  **Middleware:** Authentication logic has been introduced as middleware (`middleware/auth.js`).
5.  **Models:** A formal data model for messages (`models/message.js`) has been added, likely using Mongoose or a similar ODM.

## Feature Changes

1.  **API Endpoints:**
    *   `/api/messages`: Endpoint to retrieve archived messages, possibly with filtering (`api/messages.js`).
    *   `/api/summarize`: Endpoint to generate summaries of messages using OpenAI (`api/summarize.js`).
    *   `/api/email-summary`: Endpoint to trigger sending email summaries (`api/email-summary.js`).
2.  **Script Changes:**
    *   `scripts/archive-messages.js` (Deleted): The original message archiving script has been removed. Its functionality might be integrated elsewhere or replaced, possibly triggered via an API call or a different mechanism.
    *   `scripts/format-messages.js`: New script to format messages, likely used for generating plain text outputs (related to `docs/03-how-to-add-messages-txt-output.md`).
    *   `scripts/send-daily-summary.js`: New script for automating the sending of daily email summaries.
3.  **Summarization:** Integration with OpenAI enables message summarization capabilities.
4.  **Email Notifications:** The application can now send email summaries.

## Testing Overhaul

1.  **Framework:** Test structure suggests a move towards a more robust testing framework (potentially AVA or Tape, given the project structure and common Node.js practices, replacing or augmenting previous tests). `test/index.js` might be the main test runner.
2.  **Mocking:** Extensive use of mocking for external services (Discord, OpenAI, Email, MongoDB) is evident (`*-test.js` files, `lib/mongo/mock-mongo.js`).
3.  **Coverage:** New tests cover API endpoints (`test/api/`), middleware (`test/auth.test.js`), models (`test/models/message.test.js`), and specific library functionality. Helpers (`test/helpers/`) suggest improved test setup and teardown.
4.  **Database Testing:** `test/db.test.js` was removed, and `test/mongo.test.js` was added, reflecting the shift to the new `lib/mongo` module and likely the use of an in-memory database for testing.

## Dependencies and Environment

*   `package.json` and `package-lock.json`: Modified to include new dependencies for the web server (e.g., Express), MongoDB driver/ODM (e.g., Mongoose), OpenAI client, email library (e.g., Nodemailer), testing framework, and potentially others.
*   `.env.example` and `.env.test`: Updated to include new environment variables required for OpenAI API keys, email service configuration, database connection strings, and JWT secrets (for auth).

## Summary

The rewrite transformed the project from simple scripts into a modular Node.js application with a dedicated API, background jobs, improved testing, and new features like message summarization and email notifications. This structure provides better separation of concerns, maintainability, and extensibility.
